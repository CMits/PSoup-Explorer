Welcome. Pick a page from the sidebar:

### 1. PSoup Explorer (original model)
- Uses the unmodified PSoup equations.
- You can mutate pathway modifiers, generate random mutants, etc.
- We plot sustained growth at 3 sucrose levels (low/base/high).
- We check linearity: lowâ†’base, baseâ†’high, lowâ†’high.
- Empirically this model gives almost perfect straight lines for *all* genotypes,
  meaning sucrose just scales everything and there's basically no GÃ—E.

### 2. PSoup GÃ—E Explorer (modified model)
- Uses a biologically informed extension.
- We add an explicit **sucrose Ã— strigolactone (SL) brake** interaction:
  sucrose relieves SL-mediated bud repression, *but only if the SL pathway is intact*.
- Now 'max2 / smxl6_7_8'-like genotypes (SL pathway broken) can:
  - branch more even at low sucrose,
  - and respond less strongly to extra sucrose,
  - so the slope vs sucrose flattens.
- This should create visible genotype Ã— sucrose interaction (true GÃ—E), which is
  what people actually report in branching / tillering biology.

Use this app to:
- stress-test PSoup as a predictor for breeding,
- show reviewers why the naive algebra cannot produce GÃ—E,
- and show how a minimal biologically grounded change *can* produce GÃ—E.
